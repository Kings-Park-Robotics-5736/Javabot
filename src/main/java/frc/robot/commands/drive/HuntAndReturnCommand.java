/**
 * @brief This is a complex class that combines multiple actions into 1 command.
 *        It is complex, because we need to require state from an earlier
 *        command to use in a later state. Built in command sequences do not
 *        support this.
 * 
 * @note This is implemented as a state machine, starting with HUNT for target,
 *       goint to RETURN TO START.
 * 
 * @note If escalatorCommnad is not provided, we will treat this as a teleop,
 *       where the user will seperately control intake and escalator.
 * 
 * @note This will ensure intake starts when we begin hunting, turns off when we
 *       finish, and once it is off, we will raise the elevator up. We ensure
 *       the elevator is all the way up before returning.
